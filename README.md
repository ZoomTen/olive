# Olive Video Editor 0.1.0 (Multiexport)

Olive is a free non-linear video editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

This is version 0.1.0, combined with [Morrolinux's](https://github.com/morrolinux/olive) export shortcuts plus support for a few export format shortcuts. I said "shortcuts" because unfortunately, the options still call upon the GUI for export (I'm sure the exporting is still massively tied to the GUI as well, and it'll need some dissecting to make it truly headless)

Doing this as I await for 0.2.0 which [*might*](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/pull/1118#issuecomment-559863183) have headless rendering, but I wouldn't count on it being in the immediate bucket list.

In the mean time, why not use this with the [Renderchan module](https://gist.github.com/ZoomTen/0005986d7e41d35bfd8ffbb95d7e3c41)?
